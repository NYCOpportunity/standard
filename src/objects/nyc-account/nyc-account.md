The <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/nyc4d/html/services-nycid/nycid.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">City's single sign-on service (SSO), "NYC.ID,"</a> is used by multiple City websites and applications for user authentication. New users of your application may have an account already. Using patterns from these websites and applications may help reduce sign-up and log-in flow friction.

For most City websites, "NYC.ID" is referred to as "NYC Account" (as opposed to "NYC.ID Account"). Copy and other references in "NYC.ID" integrated applications should refer to "NYC.ID" this way. For example, "log in using your NYC account."

The most notable integration is <a href="https://a069-access.nyc.gov/accesshra/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ACCESS HRA</a>. It may be beneficial to encourage new users of your application to use their "ACCESS HRA Account." For example, "you can also use your ACCESS HRA account to sign in."
