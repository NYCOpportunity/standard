The **Find Help** map presents a list of locations or offices for assisting users with in-person help. The list of offices can be filtered using **location based search** and **categorical service filtering**. It uses the [Map Layout](layouts#map-layout) to present the list of locations in the sidebar region and a map in the content region. The map updates location information as the user narrows their search through filtering or clicks on individual office locations.

The "Learn More" button for each location should open a new tab to ensure that the user is able to easily navigate back to the map after viewing location details.
