This Feedback Form example uses a version of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://measuringu.com/umux-lite/">Usability Metric for User Experience (UMUX) Lite</a>. This helps evaluate the perceived usability of the site using a short, two question form plus an additional question asking for one thing that could be made better. Scoring the results of submissions over time can provide an indication to the usability of the site.

---

Changing the form questions for different audiences or for collecting different types of information may be necessary.

---

It is important to use **informed consent** and consider **trauma informed** design principles for collecting feedback in different contexts. Use questions that do not re-traumatize audiences. It may also not be possible or appropriate to ask directly for feedback.

---

When phrasing the questions, focus on the task or problem the website or application is trying to solve. For example;

* *This guide **helped me apply for SNAP**.*

* *This website **helped me find work or a work program**.*

* *This app **helped me share my documents**.*
