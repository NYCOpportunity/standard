The {{ this.package.nice }} integrates the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://lucide.dev">Lucide open source library</a> for use as **UI icons**. These icons are used throughout applications to provide visual context to [Link](links) or [Button](buttons) labels and components such as [Alerts](alerts).

---

The class name `icon-ui` sets the stroke width and default dimensions for UI icons. The width and height for these icons will match the base font size for each major viewport (`1rem`). Custom sizing can be achieved using icon size utility classes described below.

---

When using the Lucide icon SVG sprite included with {{ this.package.nice }}, icon IDs a reprefixed with `#lucide-` followed by the name of the individual file in the library.

<small>The Lucide icon library is a fork of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://feathericons.com">Feather icon collection</a>, which was the previous UI icon set used by the {{ this.package.nice }}. Currently, Lucide is more actively maintained and provides an expanded icon set that can be integrated independently into different projects based on React, Vue.js, Angular, Svelte, etc.</small>
