The **Share Form** enables a user to text or email themselves a link to a web page. It uses JavaScript to post the form data to an endpoint that can pass the data to a email to text messaging service. The **Share Form** also uses the [Disclaimer Toggle](disclaimer#disclaimer-toggle) to show or hide disclaimer based on the visibility of either form input. The disclaimer provides informed consent as to how the data submitted in the form may or may not be used.

The **Share Form** exposes text messaging and email sharing directly in the interface. It is useful for sharing timely and important information as well as collecting contact information for outreach.

The [Web Share](web-share) form can be used in place of the **Share Form** to enabling users to open a native dialog for sharing URLs on the platform of their choice. The Web Share doesn't require a backend service for emailing or text messaging. However, information from the Web Share can't be collected for outreach.
