**Alerts** contain contextually relevant messages for the user. They may be used to indicate a successful or unsuccessful interaction, provide feedback for form inputs, or display time-sensitive information about content within a view. Further guidance on **Alerts** can be found on the <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/alert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) site</a>.

The standard **Alert** is suited for standard information such as inline call-outs or supplemental information. It doesn't interrupt the user's workflow, so the role is set to `region` and paired with an `aria-describedby` attribute targeting the body of the alert.
