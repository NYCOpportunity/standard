<!-- Headers start with h5 ##### -->

The Active Navigation is an in-page navigation element that allows users to understand the contents of a page. It is best used for long pages containing multiple headers, each header containing varied content and interactive elements. It is most closely associated with the <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/in-page-navigation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In-page Navigation Component in the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)</a> with a few key differences.

---

The navigation horizontally scrolls to save vertical viewport space. This enables it to remain in view by sticking to the top of the user's window.

---

The navigation includes a "Jump to top" link that will link to the page heading.

---

The `aria-label` for the `nav` element is "Jump Navigation" in this example. Other recommendations from the <abbr title="The U.S. Web Design System">USWDS</abbr> include "On this page," "In this article," or "Table of contents."
