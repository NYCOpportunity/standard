The **Side Navigation** can use an unordered list display for an in-page navigation.

The `nav` element must have a unique `aria-label` attribute to help screen readers distinguish it from other `nav` elements. Recommendations for the label from the USWDS include "On this page," "In this article," or "Table of contents."
