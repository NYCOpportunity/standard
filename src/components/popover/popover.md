Popovers are used to provide additional context. They are most commonly used within the [Question Component](question) to describe why certain questions appear in forms.

Popovers use the `aria-describedby` attribute to associate the popover text with the toggling element. The `role` attribute of the popover is set to `tooltip`.

Popovers can consolidate the amount of visible text, however, a non-urgent [Alert](alert) can also be used to display additional information and context as well.
