The Radio Question collects a single input from a short, predefined list of options. Options can be displayed in a single or double column, depending on the length of the option label.  Use the `c-question__container-cols` class on the `c-question__container` element to display a two-column layout for desktop browsers.

---

If the list of options is long and can't be truncated visually, the [Select Question](#select-question) should be used instead.

---

Option Questions use the `fieldset` and `legend` element combination to group the available options; the question is wrapped in a `fieldset` element, while the question label uses the `legend` element.
