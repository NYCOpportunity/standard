Icons can also be used to prefix questions, such as using the [User Interface (UI) Icon set](icons#user-interface-ui-icons) dollar sign or calendar icons. More examples can be found on the [Input with Prefix or Suffix](inputs#input-with-prefix-or-suffix) example.

The open source library <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://nosir.github.io/cleave.js/">Cleave.js</a> is included as a dependency of the {{ this.package.nice }} to provide input masking support.
