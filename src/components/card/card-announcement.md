Cards containing time-sensitive and non-standard information in the Opportunity Standard are called **"announcement cards"** (they may also be referred to as "touts"). They may contain one or more of the following types of information in this order; badge, title, summary, timestamp, and web share component.

---

**Badge**; a new announcement should include a badge labeled "new" to indicate timely information. The length of visibility for the badge can be adjusted but could be visible to users after the announcement is posted for 15 - 30 days.

---

The card title is the **headline**; This is the large, linked text that will appear above each announcement. It should be snappy and limited to 4â€“10 words. The title will be linked to the announcement source (call-to-action) or where users can find more information about the announcement's subject. The link can be internal or external, including the external link icon.

---

The card summary contains the **announcement details**; A concise description of the announcement limited to one sentence (or two short sentences) and around 20 words.

---

The card feature list should contain the **timestamp**; The timestamp is the date and time the announcement was originally posted or last updated. The information icon prefix is an `svg` element with its `role` attribute set to `img` so that `title` tag of this icon is treated like `alt` text for images. It reads, *"Last Updated."*

---

**Web Share**; The Web Share component should share and allow the user to copy the announcement source URL (call-to-action) to their clipboard. [More guidance on the Web Share can be found here](web-share).
